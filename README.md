  ## Installation
  To be able to run this application, the user will need to run `npm install` in order to install any dependencies that are in the package.json file. In this case the 'express' package needs to be installed. Then to run the application, use `node app.js`.

  ## Usage
  Once the user installs all dependencies and runs the application with `node server.js`, they will then get a message in the console that reads 'App listening on PORT: 3000'. To view the app, open a browser and type in 'http://localhost:3000/' as the url. They are presented with the homescreen. Once they click on the 'Get Started' button, the app will then allow the user to create multiple notes and will be able to save the notes and delete them.
